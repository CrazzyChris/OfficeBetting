# Office Betting App

This project is about creating back-end functionality skeleton for future
**_Office Betting Website_**
allowing coworkers to compete against each other in picking scores of the most popular sporting events.

###For now functionality is limited to:
* Game creation, handling its attributes and some basic methods around them
* User creation, attributes handling and methods for them

###Next in queue is:
* Placing bets by users
* Assigning points for bets based on compare with score method

####Whole project is written in Ruby, because the Website will be written in Rails :)
